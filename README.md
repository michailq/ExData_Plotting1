## Project 1 - instructions

This repository comprises four R files that generate all graphs. 

Each R file generates particular graph. 

Before you run the code in R, please make sure that the right working directory with raw data file has been specified.

Generated graphs are saved in the working directory. 

The code reads in the entire data set and then subsets only selected raws. The whole process may take a while, so please be patient.
